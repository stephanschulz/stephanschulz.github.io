            <p>Stephan is a multi-disciplinary artist who uses electronic media and custom made software to create performative electronic installations. He makes use of new and used consumer appliances from windshield wipers to iPods. Having grown-up in East Germany, he is influenced by the custom of re-purposing appliances in order to build something new. His works are clever, and often humorous while underlining current societal issues.</p>
            
            <p>Stephan is a Canadian citizen, living in Montreal, Quebec. He is Head of R+D for Antimodular Research since 2007, a new media art production studio headed by artist Rafael Lozano-Hemmer.</p>
