        <p>I am devising technologies to capture and display movements within urban spaces in order to bring attention to the potential and alternative uses of those spaces.</p>
        <p>Exercise machine is a performative and sculptural intervention that uses electronic media as body a extension in order to amplify a person's movement in size and visibility. As the performer, I wear five motion sensors that measure the rotation of my joints. While exercising and interacting with others on the sidewalk five fluorescent light tubes rotate correspondingly to my movements. Each light is rotated by a strong motor. In a rather parasitic manner these lights are mounted with custom made clamps onto street signs or temporarily installed posts.</p>
        <p>This work is inspired by Etienne-Jule Marey's chronophotography of bodies in motion and their reduction to white lines. I am joining this minimal extreme of representing a person with the spectacle of movements, lights and technology.</p>
        <p>"Man is not only a robot in his private reflexes but in his civilized behavior and in all his responses to the extensions of his body, which we call technology." (Marshall McLuhan)</p>
