            <p>“Voice Forest” is an interactive installation now on view at the Crystal Bridges Museum of Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The piece is an array of trees illuminated with up-lights that are controlled by the the recorded messages of visitors who speak into three intercoms. As new recordings get added old ones get pushed down one position. Each tree is illuminated by a different participant’s voice, so a stroll produces a connective sonic narrative. Curated recordings from diverse communities in North West Arkansas also playback from time to time, as well as selected messages received from the internet.</p>
        <p>The project has many antecedents but perhaps the most salient is our “Voice Tunnel” installation at NYC’s Park Avenue Tunnel in 2013 and “Voice Bridge” at the Blue Bridge in Grand Rapids in 2018. The project was programmed by the great Stephan Schulz and the team that made this possible include William Sutton, Faadhi Fauzi, Emily Green, Florian Thomas and many other incredible people at my studio, at the Museum, and at Ozark Productions. Particular shout-out to Benoit Soucy and Ben Huss who made it all happen.</p>
        <p>“Listening Forest” is almost a retrospective of the outdoor artworks, but all the pieces were adapted specifically for Crystal Bridges, including a couple of premieres. The show is tied together by new music by Robin Rimbaud Scanner, is on every night (except Monday and Tuesday) from dusk onwards, and it involves a 1.5 mile (2.4 Km) walk along the North Forest trail, which is a park adjacent to the Museum. The show was installed with flora and fauna impact mitigation plans, for example our computers are connected to Cornell’s birdcast migration system to automatically lower light intensity as flocks fly by. The show is fully accessible but we are also offering “relaxed sessions” with lower volumes, mobility shuttles, and other adaptations to cater to more sensitive visitors.</p>
