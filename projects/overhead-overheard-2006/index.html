        <p>With my "Boom Camera" I am walking through the streets of this city. Sometimes alone and sometimes I ask friends, acquaintances or visitors to join me. The "Boom Camera" is a 12-foot painters pole with a miniDV camera attached on the top, which looks down.It is a fairly simple tool that accompanies my walks and functions as a catalyser for conversations and encounters. The tool's presence fades out of the centre of attention and becomes a quiet witness."overhead overheard" has two sides to it one being the performance and the other is an installation in a gallery.A TV is mounted on top of a ladder, facing upwards. When the visitor climbs up and puts on the headphones she/he can listen to and watch a four-minute video of one of the performances from the perspective of the camera. Being up on the ladder bridges the gallery space and the viewing experience with the event of the performance.</p>
        <p>The video shows two people standing, looking and observing their surrounding. While the perspective on to the two people is from high up, the audio of the conversation is extremely close and intimate. The confusing perspective and the inability to identify the space of the video shot create a feeling of curiosity, uncomfortableness and floating.</p>
