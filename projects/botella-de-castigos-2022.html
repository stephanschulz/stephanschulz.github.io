            <p>"Botella de Castigos" is an artwork where thousands of bottles are presented spinning slowly on a display, creating a clock that counts 59 seconds per minute. The bottles come from popular and elite “brands” of water from all over the world, as well as AI generated bottles of brands that do not exist. The piece mixes chance, time, and product design to comment on drinking water scarcity which is becoming the issue of our time. According to scientists at the Institute of Global Health, drinking bottled water has a 3,500 times higher cost of resource extraction than tap water and 1,440 times higher impact on ecosystems.</p>
