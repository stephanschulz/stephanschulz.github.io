            <p>content: A small Y-shaped branch, similar to a divining rod, is suspended from a thread and moves with the air flow and with a small motor. Projected on the wall behind the branch is its shadow, allowing you to see the entire tree from where the branch came. Bifurcation is the second installation in the "Shadow Object" series of works, inspired by Octavio Paz and Bioy Casares, among others, who insisted that absence and presence are not opposites.Computer, kinect, projector, metal, motor, arduino processor, fumigated wood</p>
