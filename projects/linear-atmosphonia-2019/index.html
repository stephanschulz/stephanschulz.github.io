        <p>Sound environment featuring 3,000 audio channels playing on custom-made speakers with LED lights. The piece can be presented as a tunnel or room, and the recordings change typology gradually along the field of speakers: recordings include wind, water, fire, ice, over 200 types of insects, over 300 types of birds, bells, metronomes, bombs and so on. The project results in waves of complex polyphonies that emerge from the array of field recordings.</p>
        <p>This installation is part of the series of pieces investigating the perception of thousands of simultaneous sounds each playing in a different dedicated loudspeaker, —what Lozano-Hemmer calls “speaker as pixel”. A pixel is a point of light varying in intensity and spectral frequency: coordinated with its neighbours the perception of pixels gives rise to images. The question is if we have thousands of sound sources in an array if can see the emergence of a new perceptible complexity beyond the expected cacaphony? (short answer: yes).</p>
