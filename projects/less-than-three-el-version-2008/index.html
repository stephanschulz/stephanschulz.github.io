            <p>"Less than Three" is an interactive installation of light strips that form a network between two intercoms. As a participant speaks into an intercom, his or her voice is translated into corresponding flashes of light and this light pattern is transmitted visually along one of the several possible pathways through the network. When it reaches the other side, the viewer's phrase is once again released as sound. Several voices can be carried simultaneously and the short contributions travel fast through the network and the longer ones take longer. The piece stores up to 600,000 recordings and can optionally play them back at random after a period of inactivity.</p>
        <p>There are two versions of the project: a large version that uses white light emitting diode (LED) strips that can be installed indoor or outdoor and a small version using red electro-luminiscent (EL) wires.</p>
