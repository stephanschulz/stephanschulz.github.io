        <p>Imagine a flawless cube made out of crystal, measuring exactly one cubic metre: it might not get noticed due to its transparency and minimum number of facets to reflect light. Visually, this cube could be mistaken for being nothing, something that is not there. Now imagine that, due to an inexplicable "big bang" starting at its centre, the cube explodes into 7,000 unique shards expelled in all directions. The installation "Pulse Voronoi" proposes a walk through the resulting cloud of crystals, shortly after the blast. The shards of crystal are all around the same size but they have a plethora of facets created by a "Voronoi diagram", a mathematical pattern which describes many natural formations of facets, from geology to astronomy. If time were to rewind all the shards of crystal could be returned to build the perfect cube again, like a metaphor of the uniqueness of each galaxy in the universe that can trace back its existence to the cosmological big bang</p>
