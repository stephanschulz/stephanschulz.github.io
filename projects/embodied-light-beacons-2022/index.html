<p>“Embodied Light Beacons” is an interactive installation now on view at the Crystal Bridges Museum of Art in Bentonville, Arkansas. The piece features three “stick figures” or “light puppets” controlled by visitors’ body movement and pose. As you point at each other, and at features in the surrounding area, the piece produces sound and light effects.</p>
<p>The project was programmed by Stephan Schulz with tracking system and environment programmed by Lingdong Huang and Roy Macdonald. The team that made this possible include William Sutton, Florian Thomas, and many other incredible people at my studio, at the Museum, and at Ozark Productions. Particular shout-out to Benoit Soucy and Ben Huss who made it all happen.</p>
<p>“Listening Forest” is almost a retrospective of my outdoor artworks, but all the pieces were adapted specifically for Crystal Bridges, including a couple of premieres. The show is tied together by new music by Robin Rimbaud Scanner, is on every night (except Monday and Tuesday) from dusk onwards, and it involves a 1.5 mile (2.4 Km) walk along the North Forest trail, which is a park adjacent to the Museum. The show was installed with flora and fauna impact mitigation plans, for example our computers are connected to Cornell’s birdcast migration system to automatically lower light intensity as flocks fly by. The show is fully accessible but we are also offering “relaxed sessions” with lower volumes, mobility shuttles, and other adaptations to cater to more sensitive visitors.</p>
